### Hi there 👋

I am a research fellow at the [University of Southern Queensland](https://www.unisq.edu.au/research/institutes-centres/iaess/centre-for-astrophysics) in Brisbane, Australia.

- 🔭 I work on integral field spectroscopic data, in particular using the MUSE instrument on the VLT with 🚗 the [Close AGN Reference Survey (CARS)](https://cars-survey.github.io/), looking at local active galaxies.
- 🔥 I also work with the galaxy pair merger FIRE simulations to study how galaxy kinematics evolve as galaxies collide
