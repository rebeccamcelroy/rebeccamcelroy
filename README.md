### Hi there 👋

I am a research fellow in the School of Maths and Physics at the [University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/) in Brisbane, Australia.

- 🔭 I work on integral field spectroscopic data, in particular using the MUSE instrument on the VLT with the 🚗 the [Close AGN Reference Survey (CARS)](https://cars-survey.github.io/), looking at local active galaxies.
- 🔥 I also work with the galaxy pair merger FIRE simulations to study how galaxy kinematics evolve as galaxies collide
