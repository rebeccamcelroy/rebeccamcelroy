### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a research fellow at the [University of Southern Queensland](https://www.unisq.edu.au/research/institutes-centres/iaess/centre-for-astrophysics) in Brisbane, Australia.

- I work on integral field spectroscopic data, in particular using the MUSE instrument on the VLT with ðŸš— the [Close AGN Reference Survey (CARS)](https://cars-survey.github.io/), looking at local active galaxies ðŸ”­
- I also work with Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time looking for variable supermassive black holes.
