### Hi there 👋

I am a research fellow in the School of Maths and Physics at the [University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/) in Brisbane, Australia.

- 🔭 I work on integral field spectroscopic data, in particular using the MUSE instrument on the VLT, with two teams:
  - 🚗  the [Close AGN Reference Survey (CARS)](https://cars-survey.github.io/), looking at local active galaxies, and
  - 🦷 [Physics at High Angular Resolution in Nearby Galaxies (PHANGS)](https://sites.google.com/view/phangs/home), studying nearby star forming galaxies
- 🔥 I also work with the galaxy pair merger FIRE simulations to study how galaxy kinematics evolve as galaxies collide
  - 📝 see our paper here: [arXiv:2206.07545](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07545)
